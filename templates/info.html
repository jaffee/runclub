        <h1>Hello Cardinals!</h1>

        <p>We're excited to announce a new season of Clayton Run Club! For those unfamiliar with Run Club, it is a 100% volunteer-led after school activity where we record the number of laps completed around the Clayton track and students get small prizes at certain milestones. Your child does not need to be a star athlete to participate, the only requirement is that they keep moving! Run Club is open to all Kinder-5th grade Clayton students and meets every Wednesday (weather permitting) starting immediately after school until 4pm. The Fall semester will run from 10/1 to 12/10. Spring will run from 2/18 to 4/29.</p>

        <p><strong>Registration is limited to the first 90 runners so don't delay!</strong> This year, we're allowing for Fall AND Spring registration; however, payment for both semesters is due at the time of registration and will not be refundable if you choose not to continue. Yes, there will be another opportunity to register in the Spring if you want to wait and see how it goes.</p>

Venmo to <a href="https://account.venmo.com/u/Matthew-Jaffee-1" target="_blank">@Matthew-Jaffee-1</a> and please note Child's Name(s) - Run Club Registration.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
        <p><strong>Run Club is 100% volunteer based and cannot operate without your help!</strong> The track is a rocky, uneven trail behind the school, so we need enough volunteers to maintain good supervision and scan laps for all the kids.  With the exception of lap scanners, all volunteers (and awesome cheerleader families) are welcome to walk or run along with the kids! Can't help in person? No problem, we've got other ways to help. There will be a Signup Genius sent out in September after registration closes.</p> 

        <h2>T-Shirts</h2>
        <p>Your child has an opportunity to help design this year's Run Club t-shirt. Create your designs at <a href="https://www.customink.com/ndx/?PK=1790621&SK=1790600&prefer_singles=false#/welcome">Custom Ink</a>. Please submit designs to <a href="mailto:claytonrunclub+shirt@gmail.com">claytonrunclub+shirt@gmail.com</a> by September 7th.</p>
        <p><em>*Note - we have a limited number of vintage Run Club shirts available! If you're interested, please contact us. Shirts can be purchased for a donation of your choosing!*</em></p>

        <h2>Pickup</h2>
        <p>Pickup is at 4 o'clock sharp. If you are routinely late for pickup, you'll be asked to make other arrangements or leave run club.</p>
        <h2>Weather</h2>
        <p>In the event of bad weather or poor track conditions, we'll notify the contacts we have on file at least 24 hours before the start of run club to cancel. If unsafe weather develops within the 24 hour period, we'll notify as soon as possible, and keep the students inside until they can be picked up.</p>

        <h2>Mileage Reports</h2>
        <p>This year, we intend to make all the runners' data visible on this website in various ways such as per-grade leaderboards. There will be a shared login so that not just anyone on the internet can see this information.</p>
        <p>If you don't want your child's running data to be visible there will be an option to opt out during registration.</p>
